CMB quadratic estimator related calculation. Mostly it concerns
normalization of quadratic estimators, though it's not limited to
that. The core of this code is a symbolic factorization of double
l-space summation of quadratic terms in wigner 3j symbols. Such terms
are most often seen in the calculation of lensing normalization.

** Installation
In Julia REPL, first type =]= to enter package management mode. First install
its dependent library
#+begin_src julia
add https://github.com/guanyilun/Wignerd.jl
#+end_src
then install Symlen.jl with
#+begin_src julia
add https://github.com/guanyilun/laughing-succotash
#+end_src
Note that the installation is only tested on Julia 1.7, so I recommend
trying this version first in case you encounter any installation
problem. If problem still resides please let me know.
** A demonstration of building a calculator for source estimator
The workflow for building a calculator is the following. Consider the estimator
for source in CMB. One first need to provide an analytic expression, of the
quantity that we want to calculate as a sum of ℓ₁ and ℓ₂. For example, in
the below example, we are interested in ~R~.
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  using Symlens

  # provide an analytic expression: here R is what we are interested to
  # sum over ℓ₁ and ℓ₂
  @syms ℓ ℓ₂ ℓ₁ y(ℓ) f(ℓ)

  W = ((2ℓ+1)*(2ℓ₁+1)*(2ℓ₂+1)/4π)^(1/2)*w3j(ℓ₁,ℓ₂,ℓ,0,0,0)*y(ℓ₁)*y(ℓ₂)
  R = (W^2*f(ℓ₁)*f(ℓ₂))/(2*(2*ℓ+1))
#+END_SRC

Then one can easily build a calculator for it with
~build_l12sum_calculator~ function. To use this function, we
first provide our target expression which is ~R~, and then we provide
a function name, which we can use to call the built function, here we
named it =source_ext=. The third parameter is a dictionary that tells
our code how we can map our symbolic quantities to actual variables in
the function, and subsequently, in the fourth parameter, tells the
code how these parameters are to be passed in, i.e., in what
order. The last parameter tells the code whether one should return the
function as an expression, which can then be saved to a text file and
loaded later, or to turn it into a function reachable in our scope.
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  @syms fl yl

  build_l12sum_calculator(
      R, "source_est",
      Dict(f(ℓ)=>fl, y(ℓ)=>yl),
      [fl, yl],
      evaluate=false
  ) |> println
#+END_SRC

The output of this code will look like
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
function source_est(lmax, fl, yl)
    npoints = ((max(lmax, length.([fl, yl])...) * 3 + 1) / 2 |> round) |> Int
    glq = glquad(npoints)
    ℓ = collect(0:max(length.([fl, yl])...) - 1)
    zeta_1 = @__dot__(fl*(yl^2))
    zeta_1 = cf_from_cl(glq, 0, 0, zeta_1; prefactor = true)
    res = cl_from_cf(glq, 0, 0, lmax, @__dot__(6.283185307179585(zeta_1^2))) |> (x->begin
                    x .*= @__dot__(0.5)
                    x
                end)
    res
end
#+END_SRC
which is an expression of the function. One can see that it places our
input variables in the defined order. The additional parameter ~lmax~
is added by default which tells the code what is the maximum ℓ to
calculate. The ~cf_from_cl~ calls are converting our ℓ space
quantities to angular space, and ~cl_from_cf~ calls are the
opposite. This shows how our code factors ℓ space convolution into a
real space multiplication to speed-up the calculation. The result is
returned in the ~res~ variable by default.  Knowing this is important
because sometimes one may need to do something to the result before
returning. For example, we may want to return ~1 / res~ instead of
~res~. To do that, there is an option in ~build_l12sum_calculator~
called ~post~ which allows one to pass a Vector of arbitrary
expression. We can then write the following
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  @syms fl yl

  build_l12sum_calculator(
      R, "source_est",
      Dict(f(ℓ)=>fl, y(ℓ)=>yl),
      [fl, yl],
      post=[:(res .^= -1)],
      evaluate=false,
  ) |> println
#+END_SRC

Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
function source_est(lmax, fl, yl)
    npoints = ((max(lmax, length.([fl, yl])...) * 3 + 1) / 2 |> round) |> Int
    glq = glquad(npoints)
    ℓ = collect(0:max(length.([fl, yl])...) - 1)
    zeta_1 = @__dot__(fl*(yl^2))
    zeta_1 = cf_from_cl(glq, 0, 0, zeta_1; prefactor = true)
    res = cl_from_cf(glq, 0, 0, lmax, @__dot__(6.283185307179585(zeta_1^2))) |> (x->begin
                    x .*= @__dot__(0.5)
                    x
                end)
    res .^= -1
    res
end
#+END_SRC
As you can see, the line we specified in ~post~ is inserted right
before returning. Similarly there is also a ~pre~ option to add
statements before computing the ~zeta~ variables, which work in a
similar way so we will not demonstrate again.

Next we can actually evaluate the function, 
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  @syms fl yl

  build_l12sum_calculator(
      R, "source_est", 
      Dict(f(ℓ)=>fl, y(ℓ)=>yl),
      [fl, yl],
      post = [:(res .^= -1)],
      evaluate=true
  )
#+END_SRC
Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
source_est (generic function with 1 method)
#+END_SRC
This tells us that the calculator is successfully evaluated and
inserted to our scope. We can compare it to a similar calculator
implemented in =tempura= which is a hardcoded fortran calculator,
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
using PyCall, BenchmarkTools, Plots
@pyimport numpy as np
@pyimport pytempura as tp

# load cmb power spectrum
cls = np.loadtxt("data/cosmo2017_10K_acc3_lensedCls.dat")

# make a dummy noise model for testing
lmax = 3000
l = collect(0:lmax)
nltt = @. 10*(1+l/1000)^(3)  # dummy
cltt = [0,0,cls[1:3000-1,2]...]
ocltt = nltt + cltt

# tempura call
ucl = Dict("TT" => cltt)
tcl = Dict("TT" => ocltt);
res_py = tp.get_norms(["src"], ucl, tcl, 2, 3000,3000)["src"]

# our dynamically built function
yl = one.(l)
fl = 1 ./ ocltt
res_sym = source_est(3000, fl, yl)

# compare the results
plot(l, [res_py res_sym], labels=["tempura" "Symlens"], xaxis=:log10, xlim=(2,3000), title="source TT")
#+END_SRC

Output:

[[./data/example.png]]

This shows that our calculator is in an excellent agreement with
=tempura=, without us manually writing fortran code! How is the
performance of our dynamically build calculator compared to Fortran
code?

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
@btime tp.get_norms(["src"], $ucl, $tcl, 0, 3000,3000)["src"]; 
#+END_SRC
Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC ascii
805.793 ms (75 allocations: 26.67 KiB)
#+END_SRC 

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
@btime source_est(3000, $fl, $yl);
#+END_SRC
Output:
#+BEGIN_SRC ascii
14.334 ms (9073 allocations: 750.70 KiB)
#+END_SRC
This shows that our new calculator is ~ 60 times faster than the
previous code. Note that the performance gain is not due to us
building the function dynamically, nor due to performance of julia
versus fortran. It is mostly coming from the wigner d calculator which
I implemented in a separate [[https://github.com/guanyilun/Wignerd.jl][repo]]. It is implemented based on an
iteration-free algorithm, thanks to the =FastGaussianQuadrature.jl=
library, that solves the quadrature weights in O(1) complexity. This
is much faster (~200x) than the Newton's method approach implemented
in =tempura=. The wigner d recursive calculation itself is also about
a factor of 2-4 faster due to SIMD optimization thanks to the
=LoopVectorization.jl= package.
