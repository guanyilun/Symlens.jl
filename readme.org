CMB quadratic estimator related calculation. Mostly it concerns
normalization of quadratic estimators, though it's not limited to
that. The core of this code is a symbolic factorization of double
l-space summation of quadratic terms in wigner 3j symbols. Such terms
are most often seen in the calculation of lensing normalization.
